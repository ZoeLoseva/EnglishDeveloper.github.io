        <h4>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Usually, when you study abroad through your university, you get asked the 
            big question:  homestay or dorm? Loads of the people in my Japanese language 
            class um-ed and ah-ed over the choice. But not me. There was no way I was going 
            to go to Japan and A __________.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I've been living with my host family for about three months now and already 
            I've learnt so much about Japanese culture and everyday life. Manners are 
            extremely important to the Japanese, and this is reflected in the way people express 
            themselves. I take off my shoes whenever I enter a home, use special slippers 
            whenever I enter the bathroom, and exclaim 'itadakimasu' before a meal and 
            'gochisosama deshita' ('thank you for the meal') after a meal.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Before coming to Japan, I'd heard worrying stories about how it's common 
            for host families B__________.(It's actually just a family's way of showing they 
            care about your safety.) Luckily, though, my family is totally relaxed on-that front. 
            They've given me my own key so I can come and go as I please. I really couldn't 
            have asked for a better host family. They treat me like a son C__________. 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I think students who live in international dorms don't realise what they're 
            missing out on by D__________. After all, it's all the little things that make 
            experience richer. For instance, I've become addicted to my 'Japanese-style' bath 
            every night. In Japan everyone in a family has a bath at night - and the whole 
            family shares the same bathwater! That's because the point of a bath isn't to get 
            clean. The Japanese shower and wash before they get into a bath. The purpose of 
            a bath is E__________.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there's the food I get to eat every day. My classmates regularly scoff 
            down burgers. I, on the other hand, get to eat home-cooked, traditional Japanese 
            food. But that's not the only way they have of spoiling you! My host mother always 
            insists on giving me 'American-size' servings - that is, servings bigger than anyone 
            else's - despite my explaining that 'Japanese-size' portions are quite OK! It's things 
            like this hospitality and warmth F__________.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Choosing to live with a host family wasn't hard. Quite the opposite, in fact, 
            as it provided the support I needed while adjusting to a new environment.
