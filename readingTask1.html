   <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A Golden Birthday is a special, unique event that occurs when a person turns 
the age similar to a birth date. <br>For example, a girl who celebrates her birthday on  
the 17th of June will have a golden birthday in the year she turns 17.<br> A person who 
is older than 31 years will have already passed the only golden birthday and will 
not have it again. <br>Many people miss their golden birthdays because it is not a 
wellknown celebration. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;B. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Humans tend to have babies throughout the year, rather than in certain seasons 
like other species. However, there are <br> certain months when more babies are born 
than usual. These birthday months can vary from country to country depending on <br>
how close one is to the equator. In countries close to the equator November is the 
month with the most birthdays and those <br>furthest from the equator have the most 
birthdays in September. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;C. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Families can take a creative approach to birthday celebrations by letting guests 
make their own clothes or jewelry. <br> T-shirt projects are easy to adapt to any age 
group. Young children may enjoy finger painting to make <br>various designs on 
blank"T-shirt's, while teens and adults may prefer to use paint pens or fabric 
markers to produce<br> unique patterns. Adults and kids who are old enough to handle 
tiny objects can make nice jewelry. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;D. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There are many ways to surprise one's best friend for the birthday. Whether one 
chooses to give a wonderful gift <br>or throw a wild party, it is important to make the 
surprise a mystery. If one's best friend finds out about the surprise<br> before the right 
date and time, the shock element of the surprise is ruined. For the ideal execution 
of a surprise party, <br>a quick rehearsal with friends and family beforehand may also 
be necessary. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the easiest and most traditional ways to send a happy birthday message 
is to call, email <br>or send a postcard to the person. Some other methods include 
creating a photo gallery, sending flowers,<br>ordering a favourite song on the radio 
or setting up a gift treasure hunt. The message needs to be as personal <br>and unique 
as possible. It is always good to say something that expresses love and appreciation 
for that person. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;F. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The annual birthday celebration is generally marked by a cake with candles. 
The origin of birthday candles<br> is related to a Greek tribute to the moon goddess. 
Artemis. Candles were lit and placed on a cake as a tribute <br>to her beauty. Later, in 
Germany, children celebrated a birthday with a cake alight with one candle for 
each year of life, <br>plus one extra candle to represent the expectation of living 
another year. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Many classic games such as musical chairs, hot potato and Simon Says work 
well as birthday party entertainment. <br>Games should match the age, abilities and 
interests of the party guests. Bingo is simple enough to fit any party context <br>by 
filling the squares with related words or images. Pictures work best for young kids 
who can't read yet. <br>Pin the tail on the donkey is another game that is easy to adapt 
to various party themes. <br> <br>
