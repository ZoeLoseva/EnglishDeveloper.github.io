        <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Task 1. Imagine that you are preparing a project with your friend. You have found some interesting material for the presentation and you want to read this text to your friend. You have 1.5 minutes to read the text silently, then be ready to read it out aloud. You will not have more than 1.5 minutes to read it.</h3>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first human carrying flight technology was the hot air balloon. While unmanned balloons have been around in some form for thousands of years, the first flight with people aboard was in 1782. The large balloon on top is called an “envelope”. It holds hot air created by a heat source known a burner. The burner creates an open flame by burning a mix of propane and air. Hot air balloons are capable of floating because the hot air inside the envelope has a lower density than the colder air outside. The top of the balloon usually has a vent which allows the pilot to control the speed of ascent or descent. Passengers typically stand in a basket beneath the envelope. While most envelopes have a standard balloon shape, others are designed to look like animals, cartoon characters and other fun objects.
